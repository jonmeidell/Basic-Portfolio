I was born in Arizona and moved around to southern California, Utah, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Utah again; I have lived in Utah longer than anywhere else, so I now consider myself a Utahn.  (I will say I like having 4 seasons a lot better than perpetual summer, it can get a little boring for me).</p>

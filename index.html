                    <main>Let me introduce myself.  My name is Jonathan Meidell.  I was born in Arizona and moved around to southern California, Utah, SÃ£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Utah again; I have lived in Utah longer than anywhere else, so I now consider myself a Utahn.  (I will say I like having 4 seasons a lot better than perpetual summer, it can get a little boring for me).</main></p>
                    <aside>I like to go hiking and mountain biking, playing video games, dorodongo, photography (landscapes and abstract), and making music (mostly electronica).</aside>
